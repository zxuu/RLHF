Proportionality means that one quantity varies directly with another quantity. For example, if two quantities x and y are said to be proportional, then there exists a constant k such that y=kx. \n\nNow, given that the salary of a worker is proportional to the square root of the number of hours worked per week, we can write this relationship as follows:\n\nSalary=K*sqrt(No.of Hours Worked)\n\nwhere K is a constant representing the proportionality factor.
